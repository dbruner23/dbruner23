- 👋 Hi, I’m @dbruner23.
- 👀 I’m interested in life's unending algorithm.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MERN full stack development, CI/CD, DevOps, and general cloud-based wizardry, plus bioinformatics algorithms in Python, and deep learning with Tensor Flow in my spare time.
- 💞️ I’m keen to collaborate on anything interesting, especially anything to help humans understand and positively impact the future of life in the universe.
